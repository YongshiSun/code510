                <h4> Pass the Boba is a table top card game inspired by Exploding Kittens and SushiGo. The game's objective is to get as much boba points as possible. 
                  However, along the way, some players might realize that they are lactose, in which case they will have to try to lose those boba points. This game will 
                  cause players to sabotogze each other to the point where friendships might end. This was my very first card game that I worked on for my Visual Communication 
                  and Interaction Design class. The Professor urged us to try and make a card game all by ourselves so this project was quite stressful since I had to work alone
                  and was not experienced in the drawing aspect. However, after finally finishing this game, I've come to really love my work. My goal when making 
                  this game is to make it easy to play but hard to master.</h4>
